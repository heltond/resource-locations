This repository uses geospatial data, Jupyter, and HTML to create a basic functional web map. The Jupyter client accesses web-based files without the need to download them, and then processes them into usable JSON or CSV files for use in an HTML-based map. The goal of this map is to display mineral resources in the United States. To do so, it curates a global dataset by comparing location data to nationl boundaries.
